## About The Project

Today, music has become an integral part of everyone's life. The media libraries of streaming services contain tens of millions of unique compositions and their modified versions (remixes).
Music is used by people everywhere - in movies, in video games, in shopping centers. A huge number of authors produce new tracks and albums every day. 

However, it is increasingly difficult to create new music - many patterns (or combinations of chords) are copyrighted and cannot be used by third parties due to further negative legal consequences, new songs often use old motives performed using other musical instruments. To solve this problem, humanity decided to use neural networks and generate unique music using giant datasets with already existing music. 

Music generating services help musicians find completely new sounds for themselves, be inspired by new rhythms, and create beautiful works. Content makers from various video platforms can use this music in their work without fear of blocking or litigation, game developers and movie audio directors - as soundtracks. Small and medium businesses like cafes, restaurants and malls can use generated background music. 

However, all these services are closed source, require a paid subscription and do not disclose the details of creating musical compositions. So, there is my open-source service for generating music using neural networks on a free basis, taking into account the shortcomings of existing solutions. End users of this service can freely use the generated melodies for commercial and non-commercial (recreational) purposes under a free license.
